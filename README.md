# social-dynamics-model
Social dynamics model, demonstrating how opinions in a social network change over time.

The model is based on rules for how new relationships are formed (or existing ones break over time), the amount of influence each individual has on others, and the way individuals change their opinions based on their environment.

The implementation is using NetworkX.
